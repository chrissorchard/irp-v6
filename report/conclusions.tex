\section{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Current state of measurement of IPv6 deployment
    \item Do we need better measurements?
    \item Would it help?
    \item If so, what might better measurements consist of?
    \item How can the deployment of IPv6 be furthered or better promoted
using measurements?
\end{itemize}
