We discuss the goals and requirements for building a ldquo;measurement infrastructure rdquo; for the Internet, in which a collection of measurement ldquo;platforms rdquo; cooperatively measure the properties of Internet paths and clouds by exchanging test traffic among themselves. The key emphasis of the architecture, which forms the underpinnings of the National Internet Measurement Infrastructure ({NIMI)} project, is on tackling problems related to scale. Consequently, the architecture emphasizes decentralized control of measurements; strong authentication and security; mechanisms for both maintaining tight administrative control over who can perform what measurements using which platforms, and delegation of some forms of measurement as a site's measurement policy permits; and simple configuration and maintenance of platforms},

	abstract = {If a host can send packets larger than an Internet path can forward, it relies on the timely delivery of Internet Control Message Protocol ({ICMP)} messages advising that the packet is too big to forward. An {ICMP} Packet Too Big message reports the largest packet size - or Maximum Transmission Unit ({MTU)} - that can be forwarded to the next hop. The iterative process of determining the largest packet size supported by a path by learning the next-hop {MTU} of each {MTU-constraining} link on the path is known as Path {MTU} Discovery ({PMTUD).} It is fundamental to the optimal operation of the Internet. There is a perception that {PMTUD} is not working well in the modern Internet due to {ICMP} messages being firewalled or otherwise disabled due to security concerns. This paper provides a review of modern {PMTUD} failure modes. We present a tool designed to help network operators and users infer the location of a failure. The tool provides fairly detailed information about each failure, so the failure can be resolved. Finally, we provide data on the failures that occurred on a large jumbo-capable network and find that although disabling {ICMP} messages is a problem, many other failure modes were found.},

	doi = {10.1109/TNSM.2004.4623692},
	abstract = {Tunnels are widely used to improve security and to expand networks without having to deploy native infrastructure. They play an important role in the migration to {IPv6}, which relies on {IPv6-in-IPv4} tunnels where native connectivity is not available. However, tunnels offer lower performance and are less than native links. In this paper we introduce a number of techniques to detect, and collect information about, {IPv6-in-IPv4} tunnels, and show how a known tunnel can be used as a Â¿vantage pointÂ¿ to launch third-party tunnel-discovery explorations, scaling up the discovery process. We describe our Tunneltrace tool, which implements the proposed techniques, and validate them by means of a wide experimentation on the 6bone tunneled network, on native networks in Italy, the Netherlands, and Japan, and through the test boxes deployed worldwide by the {RIPE} {NCC} as part of the Test Traffic Measurements Service. We assess to what extent 6bone registry information is coherent with the actual network topology, and we provide the first experimental results on the current distribution of {IPv6-in-IPv4} tunnels in the Internet, showing that even Â¿nativeÂ¿ networks reach more than 60 percent of all {IPv6} prefixes through tunnels. Furthermore, we provide historical data on the migration to native {IPv6}, showing that the impact of tunnels in the {IPv6} Internet did not significantly decrease over a six-month period. Finally, we briefly touch on the security issues posed by {IPv6-in-IPv4} tunnels, discussing possible threats and countermeasures.},

While most core Internet transit providers have deployed {IPv6}, edge networks are lagging. Early {IPv6} network deployment was stronger in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, than in North America. Current {IPv6} network deployment still shows the same pattern. The {IPv6} topology is characterized by a single dominant player -- Hurricane Electric -- which appears in a large fraction of {IPv6} {AS} paths, and is more dominant in {IPv6} than the most dominant player in {IPv4.} Routing dynamics in the {IPv6} topology are largely similar to those in {IPv4}, and churn in both networks grows at the same rate as the underlying topologies. Our measurements suggest that performance over {IPv6} paths is comparable to that over {IPv4} paths if the {AS-level} paths are the same, but can be much worse than {IPv4} if the {AS-level} paths differ.},

In this approach, the Web site enables dual-stack {IPv4/6} support and resolves {DNS} queries for {IPv6} addresses with the {IPv6} addresses of its Web servers, and legacy {DNS} queries for {IPv4} addresses with the {IPv4} addresses. Thus, clients indicating the willingness to communicate over {IPv6} are allowed to immediately do so. Although the existence of the end-to-end {IPv6} path between these clients and the Web site is currently unlikely, we found no evidence of performance penalty (subject to 1sec. granularity of our measurement) for this unilateral {IPv6} adoption. We hope our findings will help facilitate the {IPv6} transition and prove useful to the sites considering their {IPv6} migration strategy.},

No overarching strategy exists to address all possible scenarios.

	abstract = {Internet routing table size growth and {BGP} update churn are two prominent Internet scaling issues. There is widespread belief in a high and fast growing number of {ASs} that deaggregate prefixes, e.g., due to multi-homing and for the purpose of traffic engineering. Moreover, researchers often blame specific classes of {ASs} for generating a disproportionate amount of {BGP} updates. Our primary objective is to challenge such widespread assumptions (“myths”) and not solely to confirm previous findings. Surprisingly, we find severe discrepancies between existing myths and reality. According to our results, there is no trend towards more aggressive prefix deaggregation or traffic engineering over time. With respect to update dynamics, we observe that deaggregated prefixes generally do not generate a disproportionate number of {BGP} updates, with respect to their share of the {BGP} routing table. On the other side, we observe much more widespread traffic engineering in the form of {AS} path prepending and scoped advertisements compared to previous studies. Overall, our work gives a far more positive picture compared to the alarming discourses typically heard: The impact of “bad guys” on routing table size growth and {BGP} churn has not changed for the worse in recent years. Rather, it increases at the same pace as the Internet itself.},

	abstract = {The scalability of the Internet routing system suffers from an increasing demand for provider-independent, non-aggregatable {IP} addresses in networks at the Internet edge. New routing architectures have been proposed that mitigate this problem through indirection between provider-independent addresses at the edge and aggregatable, provider-allocated addresses in the core of the Internet. A major challenge in these architectures is backwards compatibility. Address indirection requires support at the sender and the receiver, so without appropriate backwards compatibility support, it defeats communications between the upgraded and the legacy Internet. This paper proposes an address-indirection-based solution that is backwards compatible. The solution is shown to offer the benefits of provider-independent addressing in a scalable and backwards compatible manner, and to provide the incentives necessary to foster its early deployment.},

We propose a refinement of previous measurement studies that mitigates intrinsic measurement biases, and demonstrate a novel web-based technique using Google ads to perform {IPv6} capability testing on a wider range of clients. After applying our sampling error reduction, we find that 6\% of world-wide connections are from {IPv6-capable} clients, but only 1--2\% of connections preferred {IPv6} in dual-stack (dual-stack failure rates less than 1\%). Except for an uptick around {IPv6-day} 2011 these proportions were relatively constant, while the percentage of connections with {IPv6-capable} {DNS} resolvers has increased to nearly 60\%. The percentage of connections from clients with native {IPv6} using happy eyeballs has risen to over 20\%.},

In this paper, we collect and analyze a variety of data to characterize the penetration of {IPv6.} We show that each analysis leads to somewhat different conclusions. For example: registry data shows {IPv6} address allocations are growing rapidly, yet {BGP} table dumps indicate many addresses are either never announced or announced long after allocation; Netflow records from a tier-1 {ISP} show growth in native {IPv6} traffic, but deeper analysis reveals most of the traffic is {DNS} queries and {ICMP} packets; a more detailed inspection of tunneled {IPv6} traffic uncovers many packets exchanged between {IPv4-speaking} hosts (e.g., to traverse {NAT} boxes). Overall, our study suggests that from our vantage points, current {IPv6} deployment appears somewhat experimental, and that the growth of {IPv6} allocations, routing announcements, and traffic volume probably indicate more operators and users are preparing themselves for the transition to {IPv6.}},

	abstract = {Transitioning an infrastructure the size of the Internet is no small feat. We are in the midst of such a transition, i.e., from {IPv4} to {IPv6.} {IPv6} was standardized 15 years ago, but until recently there were few incentives to adopt it. The allocation of the last large block of {IPv4} addresses changed that, and migrating to an {IPv6} Internet has become more urgent. This migration is, however, still rife with uncertainties and challenges. The goal of this paper is to provide insight into this transition, and possibly make it smoother. The focus is on the "network," and the paper reports on extensive measurements that compare and contrast {IPv6} and {IPv4.} Two important hypotheses, denoted as H1 and H2, were identified and validated. H1 argues that the {IPv6} and {IPv4} data planes now perform by and large comparably. In contrast, H2 points to routing differences as the primary culprit behind occurrences of poorer {IPv6} performance. In other words, promoting {IPv6} and {IPv4} peering parity is probably the single most effective step towards equal {IPv6} and {IPv4} performance},

	abstract = {Our understanding of {IPv6} usage is quite limited. In this paper, we carry out a detailed analysis of Netflow records collected from a China Tier-1 {ISP.} Many aspects related to traffic attributes and deployment issues are investigated: application types, transitional technologies, interface identifier assignment schemes, etc. Dominating of video streaming and {P2P} traffic as well as the widely use of random identifiers for privacy are most peculiar characteristics in China's {IPv6} networks. To have a better understanding of how {IPv6} network is used, we studied users' behavior from several perspectives, such as the traffic volume produced by each user, number of applications he uses and the frequency he uses {IPv6} networks. Results show that {IPv6} is only effectively used by a small fraction of the users. On the whole, our study suggests that from our vantage point, China's {IPv6} network is in the transitional phase from the initial experimental period to practical application.},
