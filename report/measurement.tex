        \item sources
        \item analysis of data
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What has been done?
            \item How can we do this?
        \end{itemize}
        \item difficulties and potential problems with the date
    \end{itemize}
    \item Prefix Allocation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item same specifics as BGP Routes
        \item PI vs. PA space, can we measure this?
        \item can relate allocation to use?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Usage Data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item same specifics as BGP Routes
        \item can we measure the extent of tunneling?
        \item happy eyeballs
        \item browser configuration (re: dual stack)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Active Measurements
    \begin{itemize}
        \item same specifics as BGP Routes
        \item Atlas and Ark
        \item how does this add to the existing other data sets?
