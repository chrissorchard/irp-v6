\begin{abstract}
IPv6, the successor to the IPv4 networking protocol is now 15 years old, yet is
still not substantially deployed across the internet. This report explores the
approaches to measuring this deployment and the analysis performed upon those
measurements. Each technique is evaluated and compared, and the use of different
data sets in combination is investigated. It is found that the quality and
number of measurements of the deployment of IPv6 has improved since 2008 and
that this improvement is helping to drive further deployment of IPv6.
