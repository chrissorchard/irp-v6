\begin{itemize}
    \item can we use different methods together to get a better picture of IPv6
deployment.
    \item recent changes, the current state of IPv6, what the measurements are
currently telling us.
    \item can we in any way make any useful predictions about the future of IPv6
deployment (and has anyone else made reasonable forecasts previously)
    \item spend some time explaining why IPv6 is not currently as deployed as it
could be.
\end{itemize}
