The core specifications have been standardized through the {IETF's} {IPng} working group, and the {NGtrans} working group is studying issues surrounding the challenging task of smoothly transitioning from {IPv4} to {IPv6.} The paper discusses the benefits of {IPv6} and obstacles to its deployment},

While most core Internet transit providers have deployed {IPv6}, edge networks are lagging. Early {IPv6} network deployment was stronger in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, than in North America. Current {IPv6} network deployment still shows the same pattern. The {IPv6} topology is characterized by a single dominant player -- Hurricane Electric -- which appears in a large fraction of {IPv6} {AS} paths, and is more dominant in {IPv6} than the most dominant player in {IPv4.} Routing dynamics in the {IPv6} topology are largely similar to those in {IPv4}, and churn in both networks grows at the same rate as the underlying topologies. Our measurements suggest that performance over {IPv6} paths is comparable to that over {IPv4} paths if the {AS-level} paths are the same, but can be much worse than {IPv4} if the {AS-level} paths differ.},

In this approach, the Web site enables dual-stack {IPv4/6} support and resolves {DNS} queries for {IPv6} addresses with the {IPv6} addresses of its Web servers, and legacy {DNS} queries for {IPv4} addresses with the {IPv4} addresses. Thus, clients indicating the willingness to communicate over {IPv6} are allowed to immediately do so. Although the existence of the end-to-end {IPv6} path between these clients and the Web site is currently unlikely, we found no evidence of performance penalty (subject to 1sec. granularity of our measurement) for this unilateral {IPv6} adoption. We hope our findings will help facilitate the {IPv6} transition and prove useful to the sites considering their {IPv6} migration strategy.},

	abstract = {If a host can send packets larger than an Internet path can forward, it relies on the timely delivery of Internet Control Message Protocol ({ICMP)} messages advising that the packet is too big to forward. An {ICMP} Packet Too Big message reports the largest packet size - or Maximum Transmission Unit ({MTU)} - that can be forwarded to the next hop. The iterative process of determining the largest packet size supported by a path by learning the next-hop {MTU} of each {MTU-constraining} link on the path is known as Path {MTU} Discovery ({PMTUD).} It is fundamental to the optimal operation of the Internet. There is a perception that {PMTUD} is not working well in the modern Internet due to {ICMP} messages being firewalled or otherwise disabled due to security concerns. This paper provides a review of modern {PMTUD} failure modes. We present a tool designed to help network operators and users infer the location of a failure. The tool provides fairly detailed information about each failure, so the failure can be resolved. Finally, we provide data on the failures that occurred on a large jumbo-capable network and find that although disabling {ICMP} messages is a problem, many other failure modes were found.},

There is widespread belief in a high and fast growing number of {ASs} that deaggregate prefixes, e.g., due to multi-homing and for the purpose of traffic engineering. Moreover, researchers often blame specific classes of {ASs} for generating a disproportionate amount of {BGP} updates. Our primary objective is to challenge such widespread assumptions (“myths”) and not solely to confirm previous findings. Surprisingly, we find severe discrepancies between existing myths and reality. According to our results, there is no trend towards more aggressive prefix deaggregation or traffic engineering over time. With respect to update dynamics, we observe that deaggregated prefixes generally do not generate a disproportionate number of {BGP} updates, with respect to their share of the {BGP} routing table. On the other side, we observe much more widespread traffic engineering in the form of {AS} path prepending and scoped advertisements compared to previous studies. Overall, our work gives a far more positive picture compared to the alarming discourses typically heard: The impact of “bad guys” on routing table size growth and {BGP} churn has not changed for the worse in recent years. Rather, it increases at the same pace as the Internet itself.},

The most serious one recovers the secret key from just one or two authentication attempts with a genuine reader in less than a second on ordinary hardware and without any pre-computation. Using the same methods, an attacker can also eavesdrop the communication between a tag and a reader, and decrypt the whole trace, even if it involves multiple authentications. This enables an attacker to clone a card or to restore a real card to a previous state.},

We propose a refinement of previous measurement studies that mitigates intrinsic measurement biases, and demonstrate a novel web-based technique using Google ads to perform {IPv6} capability testing on a wider range of clients. After applying our sampling error reduction, we find that 6\% of world-wide connections are from {IPv6-capable} clients, but only 1--2\% of connections preferred {IPv6} in dual-stack (dual-stack failure rates less than 1\%). Except for an uptick around {IPv6-day} 2011 these proportions were relatively constant, while the percentage of connections with {IPv6-capable} {DNS} resolvers has increased to nearly 60\%. The percentage of connections from clients with native {IPv6} using happy eyeballs has risen to over 20\%.},

The {XML} based messaging paradigm of {RESTful} services has made it possible to compose various services together. Such compositions of {RESTful} services is widely referred to as Mashups. In this paper, we outline the limitations in current approaches to creating mashups. We address these limitations by proposing a framework called as {SA-REST.} {SA-REST} adds semantics to {RESTful} services. Our proposed framework builds upon the original ideas in {WSDL-S}, our {W3C} submission, which was subsequently adapted for Semantic Annotation of {WSDL} ({SAWSDL)}, now a {W3C} proposed recommendation. We demonstrate use of microformats for semantic annotation of {RESTful} services and then the use of such semanti- cally enabled services with better support for interoperability for creating dynamic mashups called {SMashups.}},

New routing architectures have been proposed that mitigate this problem through indirection between provider-independent addresses at the edge and aggregatable, provider-allocated addresses in the core of the Internet. A major challenge in these architectures is backwards compatibility. Address indirection requires support at the sender and the receiver, so without appropriate backwards compatibility support, it defeats communications between the upgraded and the legacy Internet. This paper proposes an address-indirection-based solution that is backwards compatible. The solution is shown to offer the benefits of provider-independent addressing in a scalable and backwards compatible manner, and to provide the incentives necessary to foster its early deployment.},

On the other hand, {RESTful} resources creation, destruction and other dynamic aspects of distributed {HTTP} computations involving coordination between {HTTP} agents and services are modeled using process calculus style named channels and message passing mechanisms. The resulting model allows for a complete and rigorous description of resource based web systems, where agents taking part in a computation publish data encoded according to semantic standards through public triple repositories identified by well known {URIs.} The model can be used to describe complex interaction scenarios where coordination and composition of resources are required. One of such scenarios taken from the literature about web services choreography is analyzed from the point of view of the proposed model. Finally, possible extensions to the formalism, such as the inclusion of a description logics based type system associated to the semantic resources or possible extensions to {HTTP} operations are briefly explored.},

In this paper, we collect and analyze a variety of data to characterize the penetration of {IPv6.} We show that each analysis leads to somewhat different conclusions. For example: registry data shows {IPv6} address allocations are growing rapidly, yet {BGP} table dumps indicate many addresses are either never announced or announced long after allocation; Netflow records from a tier-1 {ISP} show growth in native {IPv6} traffic, but deeper analysis reveals most of the traffic is {DNS} queries and {ICMP} packets; a more detailed inspection of tunneled {IPv6} traffic uncovers many packets exchanged between {IPv4-speaking} hosts (e.g., to traverse {NAT} boxes). Overall, our study suggests that from our vantage points, current {IPv6} deployment appears somewhat experimental, and that the growth of {IPv6} allocations, routing announcements, and traffic volume probably indicate more operators and users are preparing themselves for the transition to {IPv6.}},

The lack of machine-understandable semantics in the technical specifications and classification schemes used for retrieving services, prevent {UDDI} registries from supporting fully automated and thus truly effective service discovery. This paper presents the implementation of a semantically-enhanced registry that builds on the {UDDI} specification and augments its service publication and discovery facilities to overcome the aforementioned limitations.

We propose a microformat called {hRESTS} ({HTML} for {RESTful} Services) for machine-readable descriptions of Web {APIs}, backed by a simple service model. The {hRESTS} microformat describes main aspects of services, such as operations, inputs and outputs. We also present two extensions of {hRESTS:} {SA-REST}, which captures the facets of public {APIs} important for mashup developers, and {MicroWSMO}, which provides support for semantic automation.},

	abstract = {The potential to achieve dynamic, scalable and cost-effective marketplaces and {eCommerce} solutions has driven recent research efforts towards so-called Semantic Web Services that are enriching Web services with machine-processable semantics. To this end, the Web Service Modeling Ontology ({WSMO)} provides the conceptual underpinning and a formal language for semantically describing all relevant aspects of Web services in order to facilitate the automatization of discovering, combining and invoking electronic services over the Web. In this paper we describe the overall structure of {WSMO} by its four main elements: ontologies, which provide the terminology used by other {WSMO} elements, Web services, which provide access to services that, in turn, provide some value in some domain, goals that represent user desires, and mediators, which deal with interoperability problems between different {WSMO} elements. Along with introducing the main elements of {WSMO}, we provide a logical language for defining formal statements in {WSMO} together with some motivating examples from practical use cases which shall demonstrate the benefits of Semantic Web Services.},

We argue that the value of {SAWSDL} cannot be realized until its use is specified, and its benefits explained, in connection with a particular framework. This paper is an important first step toward meeting that need, with respect to {OWL-S.} We explain what {OWL-S} constructs are appropriate for use with the various {SAWSDL} annotations, and provide a rationale and guidelines for their use. In addition, we discuss some weaknesses of {SAWSDL}, and identify some ways in which {OWL-S} could evolve so as to integrate more smoothly with {SAWSDL.}},

Richer semantics can enable fuller, more flexible automation of service provision and use, and support the construction of more powerful tools and methodologies. Both sets of technologies can benefit from complementary uses and cross-fertilization of ideas.

This paper studies the architecture of the card and the communication protocol between card and reader. Then it gives a practical, low-cost, attack that recovers secret information from the memory of the card. Due to a weakness in the pseudo-random generator, we are able to recover the keystream generated by the {CRYPTO1} stream cipher. We exploit the malleability of the stream cipher to read all memory blocks of the first sector of the card. Moreover, we are able to read any sector of the memory of the card, provided that we know one memory block within this sector. Finally, and perhaps more damaging, the same holds for modifying memory blocks.},

They play an important role in the migration to {IPv6}, which relies on {IPv6-in-IPv4} tunnels where native connectivity is not available. However, tunnels offer lower performance and are less than native links. In this paper we introduce a number of techniques to detect, and collect information about, {IPv6-in-IPv4} tunnels, and show how a known tunnel can be used as a Â¿vantage pointÂ¿ to launch third-party tunnel-discovery explorations, scaling up the discovery process. We describe our Tunneltrace tool, which implements the proposed techniques, and validate them by means of a wide experimentation on the 6bone tunneled network, on native networks in Italy, the Netherlands, and Japan, and through the test boxes deployed worldwide by the {RIPE} {NCC} as part of the Test Traffic Measurements Service. We assess to what extent 6bone registry information is coherent with the actual network topology, and we provide the first experimental results on the current distribution of {IPv6-in-IPv4} tunnels in the Internet, showing that even Â¿nativeÂ¿ networks reach more than 60 percent of all {IPv6} prefixes through tunnels. Furthermore, we provide historical data on the migration to native {IPv6}, showing that the impact of tunnels in the {IPv6} Internet did not significantly decrease over a six-month period. Finally, we briefly touch on the security issues posed by {IPv6-in-IPv4} tunnels, discussing possible threats and countermeasures.},

Finally, a high level overview of an execution environment, and its relations to the conceptual model and the language introduced in this paper, are presented.},

Representational techniques being developed for the Semantic Web can be used to augment these standards. The resulting Web Service specifications enable the development of software programs that can interpret descriptions of unfamiliar Web Services and then employ those services to satisfy user goals. {OWL-S} ({“OWL} for Services”) is a set of notations for expressing such specifications, based on the Semantic Web ontology language {OWL.} It consists of three interrelated parts: a profile ontology, used to describe what the service does; a process ontology and corresponding presentation syntax, used to describe how the service is used; and a grounding ontology, used to describe how to interact with the service. {OWL-S} can be used to automate a variety of service-related activities involving service discovery, interoperation, and composition. A large body of research on {OWL-S} has led to the creation of many open-source tools for developing, reasoning about, and dynamically utilizing Web Services.},

	abstract = {The lack of an accurate representation of the Internet topology at the Autonomous System ({AS)} level is a limiting factor in the design, simulation, and modeling efforts in inter-domain routing protocols. In this paper, we design and implement a framework for identifying {AS} links that are missing from the commonly-used Internet topology snapshots. We apply our framework and show that the new links that we find change the current Internet topology model in a non-trivial way. First, in more detail, our framework provides a large-scale comprehensive synthesis of the available sources of information. We cross-validate and compare {BGP} routing tables, Internet Routing Registries, and traceroute data, while we extract significant newinformation from the less-studied Internet Exchange Points ({IXPs).} We identify 40\% more edges and approximately 300\% more peer-to-peer edges compared to commonly used data sets. Second, we identify properties of the new edges and quantify their effects on important topological properties. Given the new peer-to-peer edges, we find that for some {ASes} more than 50\% of their paths stop going through their {ISP} providers assuming policy-aware routing. A surprising observation is that the degree of a node may be a poor indicator of which {ASes} it will peer with: the two degrees differ by a factor of four or more in 50\% of the peer-to-peer links. Finally, we attempt to estimate the number of edges we may still be missing.},

However as technology has advanced it has become possible to make use of electronic tickets that have significant advantages both for travellers and for the transport system operators. There has been a lot of recent publicity regarding weaknesses in some electronic ticket solutions; which whilst based on some solid facts tend to suggest that transport ticket security and fraud control is primarily a smart {card/RFID} technology issue. However this cannot be the case as systems exist that do not use such technology; or use it along side legacy systems. This paper will consider technology problems, but will first establish the bigger picture of transport ticketing and will finally make suggestions for future evolution of such systems.},

However, most often these services lack any machine-processable description and therefore a significant human labour has to be devoted to locating existing services, understanding their documentation, and implementing software that uses them. In order to increase the automation of these tasks, we present an integrated lightweight approach for the creation of semantic {RESTful} service descriptions. Our work is based on {hRESTS}, a microformat for including machine-readable descriptions of {RESTful} service within existing {HTML} service documentation. We complement {hRESTS} by the {MicroWSMO} microformat, which uses {SAWSDL-like} hooks to add semantic annotations. Finally, we present {SWEET–Semantic} Web {sErvices} Editing Tool–which effectively supports users in creating semantic descriptions of {RESTful} services based on the aforementioned technologies.},
